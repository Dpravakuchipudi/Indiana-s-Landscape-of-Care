## 📌 Project Overview

Indiana is a state of rich geographic and human diversity—spanning wetlands, forests, farmlands, and vibrant cities. This spatial storytelling project integrates **four key datasets**—**population distribution, aviation infrastructure, hospital access, and wetlands**—to uncover the spatial dynamics of **emergency preparedness**, **conservation**, and **infrastructure equity**.

The StoryMap offers multi-layered geospatial insights:
- Population density vs. healthcare infrastructure
- Hospital and helipad accessibility gaps
- Wetland conservation hotspots
- Overlap between ecological assets and human development

---

## 🎯 Key Objectives

- Visualize how healthcare and aviation infrastructure overlaps with population and ecological zones  
- Identify underserved rural regions in terms of emergency preparedness  
- Map high-priority wetlands near urban sprawl  
- Support data-driven planning for equitable and sustainable infrastructure growth

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

- **ArcGIS Pro** and **ArcGIS Online** for geospatial visualization and analysis
- **National Wetlands Inventory (NWI)** data for ecological mapping
- **Indiana State GIS Portals** for hospital, airport, and demographic layers
- Custom buffer zone analysis to determine accessibility gaps

---

## 📈 Insights Derived

- Rural regions in southern and western Indiana show **critical healthcare access gaps**.
- Wetlands near urban hubs like Indianapolis are under **ecological stress** from urbanization.
- Certain areas show **dense infrastructure overlap**, while others reveal **coverage deserts**.
- Dual-mapping of **aviation infrastructure and wetlands** highlights the tension between development and conservation.

---

## 📢 Policy & Planning Recommendations

- Establish or upgrade **helipads and aviation medical-use facilities** in underserved zones  
- Prioritize conservation in **urban-adjacent wetlands**  
- Use integrated mapping for **resource planning** that respects both human and ecological needs  
- Engage **community stakeholders** and encourage **inter-agency collaboration** for equitable growth

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Static buffer zones (10-mile) may not reflect true travel times  
- Datasets may not capture **most recent updates**  
- Sociodemographic, economic, or real-time emergency response factors are not included  
- Climate change impacts and seasonal variability are not modeled in this version  

---

## 📚 Data Sources

- **National Wetlands Inventory (NWI)**  
- **Indiana State GIS Open Data Portals** (Hospitals, Aviation, Population)  
- **U.S. Census Bureau** and **local geospatial repositories**
